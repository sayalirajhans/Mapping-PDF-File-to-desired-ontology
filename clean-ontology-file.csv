slot,thingslot,slot,the single steps of a power sequence are represented by slots a slot is associated with a slot number while a power sequence is associated with a power sequence identifier the slot numbers of two power sequences should be considered independent from each other ie slot number 7 of sequence 1 describes a different slot than slot number 7 of sequence 2 therefore a slot is only uniquely identified in combination with a sequence id 
actuatorswitch,thingdeviceactuatoractuatorswitch,actuator switch,basic onoff operations on a simple actuator can be modelled with the actuatorswitch class whether the function turns a device itself on or off or whether it switches a specific feature depends on the implementation for example one could model the super freeze program of a freezer using actuatorswitch class an on command would then activate the super freeze program and an off command would deactivate it this example shall just give an idea how actuatorswitch can be used for more purposes than only turning devices on and off
