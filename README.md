# Mapping-PDF-File-to-desired-ontology

In this research, we propose a novel approach for mapping PDF files to desired ontologies. 
The approach utilizes natural language processing techniques such as tokenization and lemmatization, as well as named entity recognition and mapping. 
We also use sentenceTransformer for encoding the sentences and comments. 
The proposed method is based on the use of sentenceTransformer to encode the sentences and comments, and cosine similarity to calculate the similarity
between the sentences and comments. 
The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by testing it on a dataset of PDF files and comparing its performance to existing approaches. 
Our results show that our approach is able to accurately map PDF files to the desired ontology with high precision and recall. 
The proposed method can be used in various applications such as data management, information retrieval and knowledge representation. 

Procedure to follow for running the code: 
  Start with 1- PDF file.ipynb
Then 2- Ontology file.ipynb
lastly, 3- Mapping PDF file to ontology classes

The 3- Mapping PDF file to ontology classes code can be directly run if the csv files are downloaded. No need to run the codes 1 and 2.
